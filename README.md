# Roblox-Game-Template ðŸš€

This branch is an alternative version of the [Simple](https://github.com/MonzterDev/Roblox-Game-Template/tree/simple) branch, which is intended to be purely used inside Roblox Studio. This branch was made because Wally packages experience type issues when working with them directly inside of Roblox Studio.
